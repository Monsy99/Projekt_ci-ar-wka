# TBR project

## Description

A website created from a Figma UI project. This website  
is a portfolio page for a transport company to display its  
range of activities and allow a user to contact the company  
via the form in the contact section.  
The contact form used in this Github version mockup is using  
elFormo free HTML form processing tool that passes the  
information from this form to my personal email.
